# password-generator

## Description

password-generator is an application that creates a randomly generated group of characters
to be used as a password.  Upon clicking the "generate password" button, the user is prompted
to select a length for their password, which must be between 8 and 128 characters long. The User
is then given a series of prompts asking whether the user wishes to include different groups of 
characters or not.  These groups include special characters, lowercase, uppercase, and numbers.  Once 
these prompts are completed a password is generated and displayed on the screen.
